o(*￣︶￣*)o
## About 
In this enterprise level framework built on Java/Selenium/Testng, I have added all sorts of functionalites which were not really neeeded for this assesment but for future scalablity I added like HTML Report generation after Test runs(you can check that in report folder) , Utility to get data from a Json file and parse it into our Tests for Data driven Automation support , Thread Safe execution , Page Object Model implementation , Jenkins Integration , CrossBrowser testing support , and TestRunner on the basis of Profiles created like for example Smoke.
